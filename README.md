### Data Science Practice Questions
If you are clueless about which topic to start from in data science, but have some basic idea about ML, then simply give these questions a go. If you get a bunch of them wrong, you'll know where to start your preparation :)

### SQL
Quickly go through the tutorial pages, you need not cram anything. Soon after, solve all the Hackerrank questions (in sequence, without skipping). Refer back to any of the tutorials or look up the discussion forum when stuck. You will learn more effectively this way and applying the various clauses will boost your recall.

### Inferential Statistics

<details>
  <summary>Notes on p-values, statistical significance</summary>
 
 - p-values
 
    - 0 <= p-value <= 1
   
    - The closer the p-value to 0, the more the confidence that the null hypothesis (that there is no difference between two things) is false.
   
    - `Threshold for making the decision`: 0.05. This means that if there is no difference between the two things, then and the same experiment is repeated a bunch of times, then only 5% of them would yield a wrong decision.
   
    - In essence, 5% of the experiments, where the differences come from weird random things, will generate a p-value less that 0.05.
   
    - Thus, we should obtain large p-values if the two things being compared are identical.
   
    - Getting a small p-value even when there is no difference is known as a False positive.'
   
    - If it is extremely important when we say that the two things are different, we use a smaller threshold like 0.1%.
   
    - A small p-value does not imply that the difference between the two things is large.
    
 - Error Types
    
    - `Type-1 error`: Incorrectly reject null (False positive)
   
    - `Alpha`: Prob(type-1 error) (aka level of significance)
   
    - `Type-2 error`: Fail to reject when you should have rejected null hypothesis (False negative)
   
    - `Beta`: Prob(type-2 error)
   
    - `Power`: Prob(Finding difference between when when it truly exists) = 1 - beta
   
    - Having power > 80% for a study is good. Calculated before study is conducted based on projections.
   
    - `P-value`: Prob(obtaining a result as extreme as the current one, assuming null is true)
   
    - Low p-value -> reject null hypothesis, high p-value -> fail to reject hypothesis
   
    - If p-value < alpha -> study was statistically significant. Alpha = 0.05 usually

### Statistical Tests

 <details>
  <summary>Statistical Tests Notes</summary>
  
   - t-Test
   
      - compares 2 means. Works well when sample size is small. We esimate popl_std by sample_std.
    
      - We are less confident that the distribution resembles normal dist. As sample size increases, it approches normal dist (at about n~=30)
        
      - t-value = signal/noise = (absolute diff bet two means)/(variability of groups) = | x1 - x2 | / sqrt(s1^2/n1  +  s2^2/n2)
        
      - Thus, increasing variance will give you more noise. Increasing #samples will decrease the noise.
        
      - Degrees of freedom (DOF) = n1 + n2 - 2
    
      - if t-value > critical value (from table) => reject hypothesis (found a statistically significant diff bet two means) 
    
      - Independent (unpaired) samples means that two separate populations used to take samples. Paired samples means samples taken from the same population, and now we are comparing two means.
    
      - In a two tailed test, we are not sure which direction the variance will be. Considering alpha=0.05, the 0.05 is split into 0.025 on both of the tails. In the middle is the remaining 0.95. Run a one-tailed test if sure about the directionality.
    
      - Calculating t-statistic when comparing sample mean with an already known mean. t-statistic = 
    
   - Z-test: 
    
      - Uses a normal distribution
    
      - (mu, sigma) are population statistics. (x_bar, s) are sample statistics. 
    
      - z-score = (x-mu)/sigma
      - z-statistic = (x_bar - mu)/ sqrt(sigma^2/n)
      - t-statistic = (x_bar - mu)/ sqrt(s^2/n)
    
      - Use z-stat when pop_std (sigma) is known and n>=30. Otherwise use t-stat.
    
    
   - ANOVA test: compares >2 means
   - Chi-squared test: compares categorical variables
   - Shapiro Wilk test: test if a random sample comes from a normal distribution
   - Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit test: compares data with a known distribution to check if they have the same distribution

### Loss functions
 <details>
  <summary>Cross-entropy loss vs squared-error loss</summary>
  
  - Loss for a single data point (y: ground truth, y': predicted value)
    - Squared error loss: (y'-y)^2
    - Cross entropy loss: -y*ln(y) - (1-y)*(1-ln(y))
    - Average over all data points to evaluate total loss
  
  - CE loss penalizes wrong prediction more than SE loss. This is important for training a classifier.
  - However, in regression we are predicting continuous values.
  - Thus, slight deviation around ground truth is tolerable (and even desirable, otherwise we are overfitting)

### Boosting
 
 <details>
  <summary>Notes on Adaboost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost</summary>
  
   - Adaboost
    
      - Combines a lot of "weak learners" to make decisions.
    
      - Single level decision trees (one root, two leaves), known as stumps.
    
      - Each stump has a weighted say in voting (as opposed to random forests where each tree has an equal vote).
    
      - Errors that the first stump makes, influences how the second stump is made. Thus, order is important
    (as opposed to random forests where each tree is made independent of the others, doesnt matter the order in which trees are made)
    
      - First all samples are given a weight (equal weights initially). Then first stump is made based on which feature classifies the best
    (feature with lowest Gini index chosen). Now to decide stump's weight in final classification, we calculate the following. 
    
      - total_error = sum(weights of samples incorrectly classified)
      - amount_of_say = 0.5log( (1-total_error)/total_error )
    
      - When stump does a good job, amount_of_say is closer to 1.
    
      - Now modify the weights so that the next stump learns from the mistakes.
      - We want to emphasize on correctly classifying the samples that were wronged earlier.
    
      - new_sample_weight = sample_weight * exp(amount_of_say) => increased sample weight
      - new_sample_weight = sample_weight * exp(-amount_of_say) => decreased sample weight
    
      - Then normalize new_sample_weights. Then create a new collection by sampling records, but with a greater probablilty of
    picking those which were wrongly classified earlier. This is where you can use new_sample_weights (normalized).
    After re-sampling is done, assign equal weights to all samples and repeat for finding second stump. 
    
   - Gradient Boost
    
      - Starts by making a single leaf instead of a stump. Considering regression, leaf contains average of target variable as initial prediction.
    
      - Then build a tree (usu with 8 to 32 leaves). All trees are scaled equally (unlike AdaBoost where trees are weighted while prediciton)
    
      - The successive trees are also based on previous errors like AdaBoost.
    
      - Using initial prediction, calculate distance from actual target values, call them residuals, and store them.
    
      - Now use the features to predict the residuals. The average of the values that finally end up in the same leaf is used as the
    predicted regression value for that leaf (this is true when the underlying loss function to be minimized is the squared residual fn.)
    
      - Then 
      - new_prediction = initial_prediction + learning_rate*result_from_tree1
      - new_residual = target_value - new_prediction
    
      - new_residual will be smaller than old_residual, thus we are taking small steps towards learning to predict target_value accurately
    
      - Train new tree on the new_residual, add the result_from_tree2*learning_rate to new_prediction to update it. Rinse and repeat.

  <summary>CNN notes</summary>
  
  - for data with grid like topology (1D audio, 2D image)
  - reduces params in NN through
    - sparse interactions
    - parameter sharing 
      - CNN creates spatial features. 
      - Image passed through CNN gives rise to a volume. Section of this volume taken through the depth represents features of the same part of image
      - Each feature in the same depth layer is generated by the same filter that convolves the image (same kernel, shared parameters)
    - equivariant representation
      - f(g(x)) = g(f(x))
  - Types of layers
    - Convolution layer - image convolved using kernels. Kernel applied through a sliding window. Depth of kernel = 3 for RGB image, 1 for grey-scale
    - Activation Layer
